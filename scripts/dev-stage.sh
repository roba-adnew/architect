# Build Architect from the CURRENT worktree and swap the fresh bundle into
# /Applications so it takes effect on your NEXT quit + reopen of the daily app —
# no forced restart, no killing live agents mid-turn.
#
# How the swap is safe while the app is running: we do NOT overwrite the bundle
# in place (that would change the running mach-o's on-disk pages and the kernel
# would SIGKILL it on a signature page fault — "Killed: 9" / cs_invalid_page).
# Instead we ATOMIC-RENAME: build into a staging dir on the same volume, rename
# the old bundle aside, rename the new one into place. The running process keeps
# its original (renamed-then-unlinked) inode, so its pages never change and it
# is never killed; the NEXT launch picks up the new bundle.
#
# (An earlier version deferred the swap to a quit-watcher, but that raced the
# relaunch and often failed to apply — the immediate atomic swap is reliable.)
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/dev-stage.sh            build + swap (applies on next reopen)
#   scripts/dev-stage.sh --dry-run  build + stage into a temp dir, no swap
#   scripts/dev-stage.sh --debug    build a Debug build instead of ReleaseFast
