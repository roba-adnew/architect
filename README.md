A terminal built for multi-agent AI coding workflows. Run Claude Code, Codex, or Gemini in parallel and see at a glance which agents need your attention. See more in [my article](https://forketyfork.github.io/blog/2026/01/21/running-4-ai-coding-agents-at-once-the-terminal-i-built-to-keep-up/).

Built on [ghostty-vt](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty) for terminal emulation and SDL3 for rendering.

## Why Architect?

Running multiple AI coding agents is the new normal. But existing terminals weren't built for this:

- **Agents sit idle** waiting for approval while you're focused elsewhere
- **Context switching** between tmux panes or tabs kills your flow
- **No visibility** into which agent needs attention right now

Architect solves this with a grid view that keeps all your agents visible, with **status-aware highlighting** that shows you instantly when an agent is awaiting approval or has completed its task.

## Features

### Agent-Focused
- **Status highlights** — agents glow when awaiting approval or done, so you never miss a prompt
- **Agent session persistence** — when you quit Architect, any running Claude, Codex, or Gemini agents are gracefully terminated and their session IDs saved; on next launch the agents resume automatically where they left off
- **Live session persistence (opt-in, experimental)** — set `ARCHITECT_PERSIST_SESSIONS=1` (requires `tmux`) to run each shell inside a detached tmux session, so agents *survive* an Architect restart and reattach with full in-memory context instead of being resumed from a transcript. See [Configuration](docs/configuration.md#persistent-agent-sessions-architect_persist_sessions) and ADR-015 for details and current limitations.
- **Dynamic grid** — starts with a single terminal in full view; press ⌘N to add a terminal after the current one, and closing terminals compacts the grid forward
- **Grid view** — keep all agents visible simultaneously; single-click a pane to move focus to it (no shell is spawned), double-click to expand it to full screen
- **Worktree picker** (⌘T) — quickly `cd` into git worktrees for parallel agent work on separate branches; new worktrees are created outside the repo tree (configurable via `[worktree]` in `config.toml`) with automatic post-create initialization
- **Recent folders** (⌘O) — quickly `cd` into recently visited directories with instant search filtering (start typing to narrow the list), substring highlighting, arrow key navigation, and ⌘1–⌘9 quick selection
- **Diff review comments** — click diff lines in the ⌘D overlay to leave inline comments with multiline wrapping, then send them all to a running agent (or start one) with the "Send to agent" button
- **Story viewer** — run `architect story <filename>` to open a scrollable overlay that renders PR story files with prose text and diff-colored code blocks
- **MCP session control** — run `architect-mcp` from an MCP client to ask the running Architect app to create a terminal session in a requested working directory (`spawn_session`) or close one and reclaim its slot (`close_session`)
- **Reader mode** (⌘R) — open a centered markdown reader for the selected terminal's history (works in full view and grid) with live updates, bottom pinning, incremental search (⌘F, Enter/Shift+Enter), markdown tables with inline cell styling (bold/italic/code/links/strikethrough), task checkboxes (emoji), clickable links, shared draggable scrollbar, and left-to-right gradient separators before command prompts (OSC 133 + fallback heuristics)

### Terminal Essentials
- Smooth animated transitions for grid expansion, contraction, and reflow (cells and borders move/resize together)
- Wakeable idle input handling keeps typing responsive after short idle periods instead of waiting on a fixed sleep window
- Keyboard navigation: ⌘+Return to expand, ⌘1–⌘0 to switch grid slots, ⌘Arrow to move focus in grid view (plays a brief wave animation on the destination terminal), ⌘N to add, ⌘W to close a terminal (restarts if it's the only terminal), ⌘T for worktrees, ⌘O for recent folders, ⌘D for repo-wide git diff (staged + unstaged + untracked), ⌘R for reader mode, ⌘/ for shortcuts; quit with ⌘Q or the window close button (if terminals are still running, a 4-second **Undo Close** window lets you cancel before it quits)
- Git diff overlay title shows the repo root folder being diffed
- Per-cell cwd bar in grid view reserves space, and terminal dimensions track grid/full mode so content wraps inside the visible area
- Scrollback with trackpad/wheel support and an auto-hiding draggable scrollbar in terminal views
- OSC 8 hyperlink support (Cmd+Click to open)
- Replies to OSC 4/10/11 color queries using the live terminal palette/default colors so Codex and similar CLIs do not stall on startup probes
- Kitty keyboard protocol for enhanced key handling
- Persistent window state and font size across sessions

## Installation

### Download Pre-built Binary (macOS)

Download the latest release from the [releases page](https://github.com/forketyfork/architect/releases).

**For Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3/M4):**
```bash
curl -LO https://github.com/forketyfork/architect/releases/latest/download/architect-macos-arm64.tar.gz
tar -xzf architect-macos-arm64.tar.gz
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine Architect.app
open Architect.app
```

**For Intel Macs:**
```bash
curl -LO https://github.com/forketyfork/architect/releases/latest/download/architect-macos-x86_64.tar.gz
tar -xzf architect-macos-x86_64.tar.gz
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine Architect.app
open Architect.app
```

**Note**:

* These GitHub release archives are ad-hoc signed so macOS can launch them locally, but they are not Developer ID signed or notarized.
* Clear the quarantine attribute before first launch, or macOS may block the app.
* The archive contains `Architect.app`. You can launch it with `open Architect.app` or run `./Architect.app/Contents/MacOS/architect` from the terminal. The MCP helper is bundled at `./Architect.app/Contents/MacOS/architect-mcp`. Keep the bundle contents intact.
* Not sure which architecture? Run `uname -m` - if it shows `arm64`, use the ARM64 version; if it shows `x86_64`, use the Intel version.

### Homebrew (macOS)

**Prerequisites**: Xcode Command Line Tools must be installed:
```bash
xcode-select --install
```

Install via Homebrew (builds from source):
```bash
# Tap the repository (note: requires full repo URL since the formula is in the main repo)
brew tap forketyfork/architect https://github.com/forketyfork/architect

# Install architect
brew install architect

# Copy the app to your Applications folder
cp -r $(brew --prefix)/Cellar/architect/*/Architect.app /Applications/

# MCP clients can use the helper on PATH
architect-mcp
```

Or install directly without tapping:
```bash
brew install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/forketyfork/architect/main/Formula/architect.rb
cp -r $(brew --prefix)/Cellar/architect/*/Architect.app /Applications/
```

### Build from Source

See [`docs/development.md`](docs/development.md) for the full development setup. Quick start:
```bash
nix develop
just build
```

Source builds install both executables under `zig-out/bin/`: `architect` and `architect-mcp`.

## Hooks

To add hooks for Claude Code, Codex or Gemini, use the `architect` command available in the terminal:
```bash
architect hook claude
architect hook codex
architect hook gemini
```

## MCP

`architect-mcp` is a stdio MCP server for local clients. It exposes two tools, `spawn_session` and `close_session`, which forward the request to the running Architect app. It does not launch Architect by itself.

`spawn_session` arguments:
```json
{
  "cwd": "/absolute/path/to/worktree",
  "command": "codex",
  "display_name": "Issue 291"
}
```

`cwd` is required. `command` and `display_name` are optional. On success, the tool returns structured content with `status`, `session_id`, and `slot_index`. If Architect is not running, the grid is full, `cwd` is invalid, or spawning fails, the tool returns an MCP tool error with a stable `code` and `message`.

`close_session` is the inverse: it closes a terminal session and reclaims its grid slot (the same path as the close-pane keybinding, so the pane is removed rather than left dead). Pass exactly one identifier — the `session_id` returned by `spawn_session`, or a `slot_index`:
```json
{ "session_id": 12 }
```
On success it returns structured content with `status: "closed"` and the `session_id`. An unknown identifier returns an MCP tool error with code `not_found`.

For release downloads, use:
```bash
./Architect.app/Contents/MacOS/architect-mcp
```

For Homebrew installs, `architect-mcp` is also symlinked onto `PATH`; the app-bundle fallback is:
```bash
$(brew --prefix)/Cellar/architect/$(brew list --versions architect | awk '{print $2}')/Architect.app/Contents/MacOS/architect-mcp
```

## Configuration

Architect stores configuration in `~/.config/architect/`:

* `config.toml`: read-only user preferences (edit via `⌘,`).
* `persistence.toml`: runtime state (window position/size, font size, terminal cwds), managed automatically.

Common settings include font family, theme colors, grid font scale, and logging minimum severity (`[logging].min_level`). On macOS, structured app logs are written to `~/Library/Logs/Architect/` with size-based rotation at 10 MiB, including startup/shutdown markers and grid/full view transition events at `INFO`. The grid size is dynamic and adapts to the number of terminals. Remove the files to reset to the default values.

## Troubleshooting

* **App won't open (Gatekeeper)**: run `xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine Architect.app` after extracting the release.
* **Font not found**: ensure the font is installed and set `font.family` in `config.toml`. The app falls back to `SFNSMono` on macOS.
* **Missing symbol glyphs**: fallbacks try the bundled Symbols Nerd Font, then `Arial Unicode MS`, then `STIXTwoMath` (if available) before emoji.
* **Emoji alignment**: single-codepoint emoji are centered using glyph metrics; if they appear off, try a different primary font or font size.
* **Reset configuration**: delete `~/.config/architect/config.toml` and `~/.config/architect/persistence.toml`.
* **Crash after closing a terminal**: update to the latest build; older builds could crash after terminal close events on macOS.
* **Known limitations**: emoji fallback is macOS-only; keybindings are currently fixed.
