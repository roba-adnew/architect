# Handoff — grid placement verification (hide/grid)

**Date:** 2026-06-24
**Task:** Resume the previous agent's grid-alignment work and verify it (their conversation was lost).
**Confirmed scope:** the **hide/grid placement** fix — hidden sessions parking off-grid.

## TL;DR
- The grid fix is **already committed** (no new source changes from this session). It is commit
  **`c972463`** ("wip: fix hide/grid placement (hidden sessions park off-grid) + run tests"),
  now ~2 commits back in `local`'s history (`local` advanced to `7455f59` with unrelated commits
  `276e271` reload-flag, `7455f59` scroll).
- Verification results: **`zig fmt --check` PASS**, **`zig build lint` has 3 PRE-EXISTING warnings
  (unrelated files)**, **`zig build test` HANGS** at the test-run stage (not the grid code).
- The 3 new grid tests in `c972463` were **verified correct by hand-tracing** (logic is sound).

## What `c972463` changes (the grid fix being verified)
`src/app/runtime.zig` + `src/app/control.zig` + `src/main.zig`:
1. `compactSessions` now **tail-parks hidden sessions** (two-pointer partition) so the cells
   between the visible block and the parked-hidden tail are genuinely free.
2. `⌘N` and `planExternalSpawnSlot` size the grid by **visible** count (`countVisibleSessions`),
   not spawned count — hidden sessions no longer reserve a tile.
3. Startup compaction added in `run()` so reloaded hidden sessions park off-grid immediately.
4. Wired `src/app/runtime.zig` into `src/main.zig`'s test aggregator + 3 regression tests
   (`compactSessions parks hidden...`, `planExternalSpawnSlot ignores hidden...`,
   `planExternalSpawnSlot expands on the visible count...`) + fixed a rotted `control.zig` test.

Hand-trace confirms: `findNextFreeSlotAfter` only returns `!spawned` slots (hidden are spawned →
never picked); partition leaves `[visible block | free cells | hidden tail]`; all 3 tests pass on paper.

## Verification status
- ✅ `zig fmt --check src/` — clean.
- ⚠️ `zig build lint` (custom `zwanzig`) — fails on **3 warnings, all pre-existing** (confirmed
  present at `c972463^`, in files this work never touched):
  - `src/platform/macos_clipboard.zig:113` — swallowed `catch null`
  - `src/ui/components/session_interaction.zig:1545` & `:1558` — `gridCellAt(...).?` forced unwrap (test code)
  These are separate tech debt, NOT introduced by the grid fix.
- ❌ `zig build test` — **HANGS** (see below).

## The `zig build test` HANG (main blocker)
**Symptom:** compiles fine, then the run stage hangs forever; watchdog kills at 600s (`RC=137`),
**zero test output** produced.

**Diagnosis (via `sample`):**
- Test binary parks on `posix.read` on the **main thread** = Zig `--listen=-` runner waiting for
  the build server to send the next "run test" command. It is NOT executing a test (Zig's default
  runner runs tests on the main thread; if one were running we'd see its frames).
- Build server (`build` runner) main thread sits in `runStepNames → WaitGroup.wait` (Futex). Its
  worker thread is presumably blocked reading the test binary's pipe.
- => looks like a **pipe/fd deadlock**, the classic signature of a test that **spawns a child
  process (shell / PTY / tmux daemon / notify socket) which inherits the test binary's stdout pipe**
  and never closes it, so the build server's read never sees EOF.

**Ruled out:**
- NOT cache-lock contention (reproduced in an isolated git worktree with its own `.zig-cache`).
- NOT caused by the grid commit: `c972463` only added **pure-logic** tests (no spawning). Wiring
  `runtime.zig` into the aggregator adds only runtime.zig's own ~28 logic tests (Zig does not run
  transitive imports' tests). So the hanging test was **already in the aggregator** (likely
  `shell.zig` or another process-spawning module) → the hang is almost certainly **pre-existing**.
  NOTE: previous agent said "zig build **passes**" (that's the app build) — they never confirmed
  `zig build **test**` is green; this hang may have been there all along.

**UNVERIFIED:** whether the hang reproduces on `main` (pre-grid-work). Not checked to avoid another
long build cycle. **Next step to confirm:** check out `main`, run `zig build test` with a watchdog.

## Next steps for whoever resumes
1. **Bisect the hanging test.** Run the aggregator's test files individually (or temporarily comment
   imports in `src/main.zig`'s `test {}` block) to find which `_ = @import(...)` hangs. Prime suspects:
   `shell.zig`, `tmux.zig`, `session/state.zig` — anything that spawns a process or opens the notify
   socket. Look for a test that forks a child inheriting fd 1 without closing it.
2. **Fix:** ensure such tests close/`O_CLOEXEC` the inherited pipe, or don't spawn real processes in
   unit tests (gate behind an env flag), or `posix.close` stdout in the child before exec.
3. The grid logic itself needs no further unit work — the 3 tests are correct; once the suite stops
   hanging they should pass. Re-run `zig build test --summary all` and check the count delta.
4. **Visual validation of grid placement** is separate from unit tests — reload the running Architect
   app (see below) and exercise: hide several terminals (⌘J), then ⌘N — new terminals must fill the
   freed cells without expanding past blanks; restart with hidden sessions persisted and confirm they
   park off-grid.

## Infra notes (cost me ~1hr, avoid repeating)
- macOS has **no `timeout` and no `setsid`** — use a homemade watchdog: `cmd & pid=$!; (sleep N; kill
  -9 $pid)& ; wait $pid`.
- Two concurrent `zig build` on the same `.zig-cache` **deadlock on the cache lock** (this caused a
  50-min stall). A **git worktree** (own `.zig-cache`) isolates the cache. There was a second live
  Claude session also running `zig build test` here; it was closed.
- Worktree created for isolated testing: `.claude/worktrees/grid-verify` (branch `grid-verify`, off
  `c972463`). Now **stale** vs `local` (which is at `7455f59`). Remove with `git worktree remove`
  when done, or rebase its branch onto `local`.
